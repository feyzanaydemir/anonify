# Only Members

## Description

Only Members is an online messaging app where users can view and create posts.

- Visitors without an account cannot create posts. They can view existing posts but cannot see the timestamps and authors.

- Regular users without a membership status can create and view posts but cannot see the timestamps and authors of other messages.

- Users who have a valid membership code see the timestamps and authors of other messages.

- Users who have a valid moderator code can see the timestamps and authors, and they have authentication to delete each message.

- Every user has a profile where they can view their post history.
